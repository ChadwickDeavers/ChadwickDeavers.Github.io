    <header> About Me</header>
    <h1>I have always enjoyed working with computers, being born in the middle of the 90s gave me a really weird spot to come into the world
    </h1>
    <h2>I grew up messing with older computer a lot! Always trying to se ehow they worked.</h2>
    <p>I'd take them apart and put them back together and it was so much fun!</p>
    <p>But life has a way of grabbing ahold of you and one day, I wasnt taking them apart anymore, and i was no longer doing what i enjoyed</p>
    <p>Years passed and i started to grow from a boy to a teen my love crept back in, One day aroiund the time i was 11 me and my little brother started playing a Runescape Private Server called Moparscape, that evolved into us learning how to create our own </p>
    <p>That was my real start in messing with computer code, We started with a server and client we had found on a website that was in disrepair but mostly there</p>
    <p>In that Java code, I learned the wonders of coding, to a degree, We had so much fun, even started creating 3D models with a program called Metaseqouia</p>
    <p>As much as the rest of this has been tho, again, I went into hibernation for some reaosn,it wasnt until recently that i had a desktop computer again  </p>
    <p>I am stil young, and have the ability to do anything I could want or dream, I want to write programs, i dream of my computers software all being completely my own </p>
    <p>I appreciate your time, Thank you for coming to my site, It will be periodically updated forever</p>
